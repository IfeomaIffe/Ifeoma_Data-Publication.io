                            <p>I am proposing for a mixed method computational algorithm of image and text retrieval pulled from American historical newspapers to present newspapers in circulation today. Specifically, to create an image detection algorithm
                                focused on getting better recognition of persons with darker skin complexions. To ground this research, I plan on pulling methods and theories from a multitude of areas of study and will go through a short review of a few
                                main ones to establish some context. I will conclude with evaluating how the algorithms pertain to my research goals. </p>

                            <h2>Methods and Literature Review</h2>
                            <p>The project idea originating from the Newspaper Navigator dataset released by the Library of Congress, which has over 1.56 million visuals collected from over 16 million historic newspaper pages from 1850 - 1963. This dataset
                                has been made open access, along with pre-packaged datasets and the corresponding code available for public use. The datasets organized by year include images, cartoons, advertisements, and other visual content types. In
                                addition, including textual content a headline; likewise, for a photograph, illustration, or map, this textual representation often contains the title and caption, Place of Publication, Geographic Coverage, Newspaper Name,
                                Newspaper Publisher, and other metadata fields. However, because it is lacking in an adequate representation, its complete use for my study is no longer an option. This problem is addressed by its creator Benjamin Lee in
                                his findings, </p>

                            <p>
                                While this loss in image quality is marginalizing in its own right, image embeddings perpetuate this marginalization: digitized newspaper portraits of darker-skinned individuals are more likely to suffer from saturated facial features, in turn resulting
                                in these photographs being lost during the discovery and retrieval process… Though machine learning methods are often offered as panaceas for automation, this algorithmic erasure reminds us that traditional methods of scholarship
                                and historiography, such as detailed analyses and close readings of Black newspapers in Chronicling America, are more important than ever to counter algorithmic bias (Lee, 2020, p.28).
                            </p>
                            <p>Deriving from this project, I am proposing to create my own of database from first the Library of Congress API, in addition to many other APIs to locate images pulled from all newspapers, but with the specific concentration
                                on newspapers from racialized populations, where there remains a difficulty of image detection precision. The datasets will be constructed this way, one of mainly white newspapers, and one oia collection of newspapers from
                                various subcultures of racialized Americans from the 1880s to present, where sets will be grouped by every 20 years.</p>

                            <p>First, I will need to do further research into language creation of race and formulate an ethical codifying system. As stated by Martin Berger, in the introduction to his book, Seeing Through Race, “In order to conduct a computation
                                analysis of a large, digitized corpus of photographic materials, it is necessary to develop a code system for describing each image” (2011, p.11). I am thinking I may also need to construct a timeline featuring all the
                                occurrences of civil unrest in American history, in addition to a taxonomy for mapping relationships between words, and their connotations along with metadata tags. This could be transferred to an ontology to organize how
                                words have changed over time, also to describe the data models and map how they are to be used. I believe this is help simplify and organize the compounding computational theories and methods.
                            </p>

                            <p>Subsequently, I will need to conduct several rounds of web scrapping to build an alternative dataset, apart from the APIS, of present-day newspaper images. With this, I am thinking of expanding upon the textual data that is
                                currently not available in the Newspaper Navigator datasets, also whether I should include digital images from newspaper/media websites. Once a sizable corpus has been collected, I plan to use data management tools such
                                as OpenRefine, to do clean up and Libre Office quickly review data and run smaller tests of various image recognition models, while I continue building the corpus. </p>

                            <p>Once the corpus has been complied, a computational image detection algorithm(s) has been finalized, and the data analysis model has proved promising, I will then use MySQL, to run more detailed queries on all the data. The
                                next step would be to run iterations of the imaging programs and use Jupyter Notebook to analyze the statistical outputs, and run a multivariate regression or Principle Component Analysis, in addition to using it to create
                                data visualizations. There are many algorithmic options for image detection, some focusing on facial features, or the whole images, or for parsing out elements within the image, and others for evaluating artistic content
                                and style. </p>

                            <p>The first is being Computational Grounded Theory (CGT) which is relatively new. As proposed by researcher Laura K. Nelson, takes into account aspects from both traditional Content Analysis (CA) and Computer-assisted Content
                                Analysis (CCA) mixed with Grounded theory. “Grounded theory is a method designed to allow categories and themes to emerge inductively from data, culminating in data-driven but abstract theoretical understandings of the
                                underlying social world” (p.5). The traditional qualitative practice of CA uses coding – this process is clearly construed by Nelson,</p>

                            <p>[As a way to] increase accuracy, multiple coders will code the same text and their agreement on codes is checked via an intercoder reliability score. When the text is coded with a reasonably high intercoder reliability (or,
                                sometimes, by one expert researcher), the researcher then analyzes the coded text, looking for different types of patterns within and between texts (2020, p.6)</p>

                            <p>Attempting to interpret the text holistically is a difficult task, because according to Nelson there is no way to make linguistic coding scientific. According to Nelson, the process itself obscures rather than reveals what
                                the researcher is trying to say because it is relatively experimental in nature, and in many cases completely unreproducible (p.7). Nelson proposes CCA will make up for the limitations of content analysis, by using computational
                                techniques like pattern detection and pattern refinement with Guided Deep Reading to crate lexical selection and topic modeling (p.14). I believe the CGT method would be well suited for the textual content collected.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <a href="#current" name="current" tabindex="-1"></a>
                            </p>
                            <p>As for image retrieval and classification, Distant Viewing, is “a methodological and theoretical framework for studying a large collection of visual materials, by making the interpretive nature of extracting semantic metadata
                                from images more present” (Arnold et al., 2019, p.11). As described by the researchers, the first step to distant viewing is constructing, “… a representation of elements contained within the visual material-a code system
                                in semiotics or, similarly, a metadata schema in informatics” (p.11). What they call computer vision is then used to explore photography without human intervention in how it is interpreted, or how the information is created
                                and collected. The algorithm – YOLOv4 – is a recognition system used that can in real-time identify multiple objects from an image and apply boundary boxes around them. Additionally, it can be easily trained and used, which
                                makes it appealing option.</p>


                            <p>Another method, Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is another detection tool to find, describe and match local features in directly compressed images even if images have different rotations and scales. Researchers Klein
                                and Shapira, in Compressed SIFT Feature-based Matching, describes the process where the algorithm first constructs a “scale space to ensure scale invariance”, then it repeatedly blurs out the original image until it decreases
                                to half its size (p.65). These blurred images then generate additional sets of images. Afterwards, Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operation is applied, and its process is described by the researchers,</p>

                            <p>The LoG operation locates edges and corners in the image, which are used for finding keypoints. However, since calculating the LoG is computationally intensive, it is approximated by the Difference of Gaussians (DoG), calculating
                                the difference between two consecutive scales, resulting in scale invariant keypoints… Maxima and minima pixels are chosen as keypoints, which cannot be detected in the lowest or highest scales. Edges and low contrast pixels
                                are eliminated from the set of keypoints. An orientation is calculated for each keypoint, choosing the most dominant one(s) around the keypoint… Highly distinctive vectors are then created for each keypoint as follows.
                            </p>

                            <p>This method piques my interest for its implemented could drastically decrease the storage necessary for housing this data. This algorithm is rather complex, and I will continue researching it and how it works in multiple contexts.
                            </p>
                            <p>Finally, there are Convolutional Neural Network and Fully Convolutional Networks (FCN) algorithms that outputs a pixel-labeling of the various semantic entities. In Sollard et al., study, Multi-scale Gated Fully Convolutional
                                DenseNets for semantic labeling of historical newspaper images, they use FCN in conjunction with Multi-Scale Gated Block architecture (MSGB), to make dense connections and gating mechanisms which can handle a multi-scale
                                analysis of inserted image with “self-attention" (2020, p.437.) Though this approach is used for binarized images, but I believe there are aspects of the framework from which I can borrow from for my study.</p>

                            <p>If things go accordingly, an experimental idea I have is to implement a CNN, such as ResNet50 and VGG16 (Pillai, 2020) to extract features from images then combine those that have similarities from different times in American
                                history that have aligned artistic qualities (e. g. content, style, framing, movement of objects). A study by Gatys et al., uses a CNN to reconstruct content and style of two different artists from different mediums into
                                one final product.</p>

                            <p><em>When Convolutional Neural Networks are trained on object recognition, they develop a representation of the image that makes object information increasingly explicit along the processing hierarchy.8 Therefore, along the processing hierarchy of the network, the input image is transformed into representations that increasingly care about the actual content of the image compared to its detailed pixel values. We can directly visualize the information each layer contains about the input image by reconstructing the image only from the feature maps in that layer (2016, p.6). </em></p>

                            <p>I believe with a CNN there is a way to take a photograph from 1949 looking just like an image from 1959 and another from 1988 and mashed together and shown as one but viewers can tell that they were once individual images.
                                The idea being combining pixels proportionally to show a new image, combined with showing enough of the others and how they relate and come together. Personally, I have always been a visual learner, and I believe this could

                            <p>There are parts from this study that apply to my own, however, if combine with matching algorithmic aspects from the SIFT method, I believe this could be feasible. Once, the computational algorithms have been established, and
                                tests have been run, I will need to review my results in context of what I have found from what other qualitative scholars have been findings. With many options for methods, there are just as many qualitative theories that
                                could apply to this project. I will have to narrow down by those which best situate and contextualize my research goals, for now I will review the ones I have found thus far. </p>

                            <h2>Literature Review</h2>
                            <p>Beginning with Visual Semiotics and Critical Discourse Analysis which are two theories address linguistic ways relations of power, dominance and inequality is reproduced and influence the minds and actions of subconsciously
                                (Van Dijk, 1995). One of the problems with theories such as these is that they are seen to be unscientific and biased. However, this is only the case because discourse is inherently political. The CDA emphasizes the conclusions,
                                must work, prove something, and be reproducible. Semiotics, the study of signs and symbols is a philosophy to the mechanisms of creating these symbols within culture(s). It is culture that becomes the primary force, and
                                according to Stuart Hall, a renown cultural theorist, “Cultures consist of the maps of meaning, the frameworks of intelligibility, the things which allow us to make sense of a world which exists but is ambiguous as to its
                                meaning until we’ve made sense of it” (2002, p.9). Language and knowledge creation are relational, and can never be finally fixed, but is subject to the constant process of redefinition and appropriation.</p>

                            <p>Researcher Clément’s (2016) classifies three ways in which information operates. For my proposed project falls within two of the three categories of information sharing, information-as-knowledge, and information-as-process.</p>

                            <p><em>Information as knowledge is intangible since it is based on personal, subjective and conceptual understandings… information as process is the systems of powers and influence that shape information systems and therefore knowledge production, identity construction, and intersubjectivity Information- as- process — the continual state of becoming informed through understandings that are constantly shifting (pp 154-156).</em></p>

                            <p>Newspapers, like history textbooks, television programs, Hollywood movies, to music and other external ways of expression was always under constraint where certain false ideas, stories, and perceptions are pushed and peddled
                                by control agents. In most cases, these falsehoods work against disempowered communities. Texts of all forms have controlled processes in creation, dissemination, and authorization of knowledge. Researchers Cope al et.,
                                captures this point in their article looking at the impact of newspaper images.</p>

                            <p><em>Images of combat operations, both positive and negative, can take on an iconic status with the American public... One possible solution to combat the powerful influence of photos is through government censorship... Although many people commonly accept the premise of news images’ ability to sway public opinion, very little research has been done to test this assumption. Does the use of images with text affect readers? (2005, pp. 3-4). </em></p>

                            <p>This study looks at the nature of how pictorial stimuli tend to get more attention from people than the articles and how they can be used effectively to catch readers attention combined with only a few words. Newspaper photos
                                are utilized in many ways, but in the case of wartime imagery are used to convey specific experiences that most will never directly encounter and increase emotional involvement.</p>

                            <p><em>Photographs in news stories bring readers directly to the front of the action and offer a front-row seat for U.S. combat operations. Reading about a particular battle is informative but viewing graphic images of war dead from that battle allows the news consumer to feel drawn into the action...Photos have the ability to convey drama and emotion and realism in a way that text alone cannot. Visual images can short circuit higher levels of cognition and reasoning because they are more lifelike and easier for the brain to process (Cope al et., pg. 8).</em></p>

                            <p>To add another study looking at similar effects in photojournalism, researchers Fishman and Marvin in their study Portrayals of Violence and Group Difference in Newspaper Photographs: Nationalism in Media (2003). Looking at
                                only The New York Times, their results find that images of non-U.S. violence is almost always has a more severe representation depicted than of U.S. violence, and is a commonly used feature for the front-page. Even with
                                non-U.S. agents having a smaller sample, were still associated more often with explicit violence. 3.7 times more numerous than those of U.S. agents (p. 26). Though I will only be looking at domestic conflicts, these last
                                two studies show the implicit and explicit biases within published images distort Americans emotions and perceptions of violence.</p>

                                <p>The kind of results I am looking for, is in the first phase create a representational database with a sufficient corpus through image and text detection algorithms to be analyzed. The second phase if there is time will
                                    implement an experimental machine learning program once the results prove successful in the first phase. The final product be a website published with all the data and findings (datasets, lit review, images, bibliography,
                                    and anything else) for the public to have access to and to encourage reuse of algorithms to repeat these methods of other media representations, such as immigration, war, and positioning of international enemies. In
                                    conducting this research there lays ahead many potential challenges.</p>

                                <p>The first is determining how many images and data will be enough, and how should they be organized and where it should be stored. Probably have a couple backup ideas if do not have enough photos for training materials.
                                    The second challenge is creating algorithms which stem from other algorithms that presently have difficulty finding representation in photos. Additionally, I currently do not know how feasible it will be to collect
                                    the names of authors of the articles and creator of the images, and to do so across all the datasets. I also question whether this will affect the outcomes in that older newspapers may not always name the photographer.

                                <p>Lingering questions I must consider is when it comes to gathering images from contemporary newspapers is, should I use digital images and or social media images? What is classified as published media, and who determines
                                    that? And where do I draw the line for self-published/free press websites such Axios and others like it? If I do choose to incorporate self-published images, how am I to define what is considered “unbiased depictions
                                    of the truth” when filtering through the copious amount of information? Especially in today’s social climate where Americans are being considered more divided than ever before. And most importantly, how should I define
                                    the different levels of severity to the words used attached to images (for example, organize a range from peaceful protest, clash, riot, mass violence)? The greatest concern I have is once the data has been collected,
                                    clean and organized into a corpus/database, what kind of statistical analysis models should I use? </p>

                                <p>Simply put, “the newspaper ¬page medium is both an information object and a material object” (Lee, 2020). I chose the newspaper medium because of its ongoing influence on collective memory and how the positioning of racialized
                                    people in insider/outsider has considerable lasting effects. This mixed method study proposed is determined in examining both images and textual data to see what we might learn from the positioning of different groups
                                    and subgroups within their dualistic contexts. With drawing from linguistic and cultural theories, I hypothesis that not much has changed and that the racism experienced today is the same of what it was from our not-too-distant
                                    past. I also hypothesis that the messages imposed in newspaper visuals as a text, are the same. My approach being to gather as many newspaper images having to do with rioting, protesting, civil unrest and apply computational
                                    "distant" viewing to substantiate the claims of the many scholar preceding me to make convincing arguments that must be considered when making critical changes for the succeeding future.
